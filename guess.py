This is one of the simple python projects yet an exciting one.
You can even call it a mini-game. Make a program in which the
computer randomly chooses a number between 1 to 10, 1 to 100,
or any range. Then give users a hint to guess the number.
Every time the user guesses wrong, he gets another clue,
and his score gets reduced. The clue can be multiples,
divisible, greater or smaller, or a combination of all.
